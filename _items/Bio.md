I am Christine Cai(-square distributed, with 99 degrees of freedom (you wonder why 99? Well, why not?). I am currently a fifth-year <font color="IndianRed">Ph.D. Student in Economics</font> at <font color="IndianRed">Princeton University</font>. I will be joining the Applied Research team of <a href="https://prosperitynow.org">Prosperity Now</a> as a Research Scientist in the summer of 2023.
	
My research interests lie in <font color="IndianRed">applied microeconomics</font> and span <font color="IndianRed">labor, public, urban, education, and health economics</font>. I am particularly interested in issues related to segregation, migrations, educational and racial inequalities, and social mobility.
	
My <font color="IndianRed">résumé</font> can be viewed/downloaded <a href="/assets/pdf/Christine_Cai_resume.pdf">here</a>, and my <font color="IndianRed">CV</font> <a href="/assets/pdf/Christine_Cai_CV.pdf">here</a>.
